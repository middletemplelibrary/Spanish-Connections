## 1. Introduction: Sixteenth to Eighteenth Century Spanish Connections at Middle Temple 
This exhibition celebrates Middle Temple Library’s significant collection of sixteenth and seventeenth century books published in Spain, and includes some items from the Inn’s Archive on the War of the Spanish Succession of 1701-1714. Some of the caption cards were written by Nicholas Ricardo, one of our 2024 work experience students. We are very grateful to Ana Sáez Hidalgo (Universidad de Valladolid) for proofreading the captions, and correcting our errors. 
<br><br>
Relations between Spain and England in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries were fractious and complex, mostly due to the Protestant and Catholic religious tensions between the two nations. The Anglo-Spanish War (1585-1604), although never formally declared as a war, began with England's support of Dutch rebels against Spanish rule. This period saw the 1588 Spanish Armada, a failed attempt by Spain to invade England. This was followed in 1589 by the lesser known ‘Counter Armada’, when England unsuccessfully attempted to intercept Spanish ships from returning their silver hoards from the Americas, and to capture the Portuguese Azores islands, which were occupied by Spain at the time. 
<br><br>
Throughout this period, English pirates like Francis Drake and John Hawkins routinely raided Spanish ships and colonies. This was partly sanctioned by the English crown as a form of economic warfare, but with strong denials by Elizabeth I that they were in fact sanctioned. This economic warfare was grounded in the lucrative territories and trade routes in the so-called ‘New World’, resulting in English attempts to challenge Spain's dominance in the Americas.
<br><br>
Upon his succession, James VI and I sought better relations with Spain, which resulted in the 1604 Treaty of London, and an end to the Anglo-Spanish War. This was followed by attempts to arrange a marriage between Prince Charles (later Charles I) and the Spanish Infanta Maria Anna. These negotiations ultimately failed in 1623, souring relations between the two countries once again.
<br><br>
Despite the economic and military tensions, there was an active exchange of goods and culture between the two countries. Many Spanish works were translated into English during this period, and Spanish books were readily available to purchase in England. Robert Ashley (1565-1641), the founder of the Library, translated two books from Spanish: Sebastián Fox Morcillo’s De honore, and Miguel de Luna’s Verdadera historia del rey Don Rodrigo. Equally, in 1589 he translated an anti-Spanish work into English: A comparison of the English and Spanish nation: Composed by a French Gentleman against those of the League in Fraunce, which went about to perswade the king to breake his alliance with England, and to confirme it with Spaine.

## 2. Medicine 
Middle Temple Library’s collection of early modern Spanish books illuminates a pivotal moment in the history of medicine when new therapies and techniques seemed to promise victory over the old scourges of disease and wounds. Juan Fragoso, personal surgeon to Philip II and author of the very rare Cyrugia (1573), is best known as an avid compiler of information about exotic plants and their medicinal uses. Alessandro Quintilio, author of the Relacion y memoria (1609) formed part of an international network of licensees who sold Vittorio Algarotti’s ‘quintessence of medicinal gold’. Among the Library’s books we also find works by widely respected authorities, such as Cristóbal de Vega and Francisco Franco, both of whom were professors at Alcalá de Henares, one of Spain’s finest medical schools. Juan de Liaño, on the other hand, is almost entirely unknown and only five copies of his Examen (1546) exist. Reminders of the unrelenting menace of epidemic disease are on display in Franco’s Libro de enfermedades contagiosas (1569) and Ambrosio Núñez’s Tratado, published in the wake of the 1599 outbreak of plague that killed 10% of the Castilian population. Finally, Jerónimo Soriano’s Libro de experimentos medicos indicates the growing market for vernacular recipe books, intended to teach broad audiences the secrets to making medicines at home. Between 1599 and 1700, Soriano’s book went through at least eleven editions, of which this is the fifth. – Professor John Slater, Colorado State University

## 3. Juan de Liaño, Examen de la composicion theriacal de Andromacho (Burgos, 1546)
This book takes the form of a dialogue between two characters, each representing aspects of the wider theories of early modern medicine. Sylvio is the learned Galenic physician who delves into ancient texts to heal, whereas Maturiro is an old botanist who is now concerned with the practicality of using herbs and plants to heal. Their first dialogue debates whether Sylvio is working too hard – Maturiro believes work is difficult, but Sylvio believes leisure will lead to sin. Theriac (also called Mithridate) was a well-known panacea throughout the classical, medieval, and early modern period. It was believed to have been invented by King Mithridates VI of Pontus, and was prescribed by royal and imperial physicians for centuries. It was to Physicians as the Philosopher’s Stone was to alchemists: the magnum opus. – Nicholas Ricardo

## 4. Gerónimo Soriano, Libro de experimentos medicos faciles, y verdadoros (Barcelona, 1614)
Soriano (b. 1575) was a physician for the clergy and nobles. This is a compendium of medical treatments, and the work relies heavily on earlier authors’ works, and was written for the use of non-physicians. It was originally published in Zaragoza in 1595, and was published in multiple editions up to 1700. Soriano founded a paediatric hospital in Teruel, using his own funds. This copy has contemporary marginalia, in an unidentified hand.

## 5. Juan Fragoso, Cyrugia en que se enseña el examen universal della, en forma de erotemas o preguntas (Madrid, 1573)
Fragoso (d. 1597) practiced medicine in Seville, and as his talents and fame as physician grew, he later went to Madrid, where he was surgeon to Queen Anna of Austria, and after to Philip II. Fragoso’s Cirugia universal, published in 1581, was considered to be one of the most ambitious medical texts of early modern Spain. It was translated into Italian, and went through numerous editions. Cyrugia is likely a later edition of Fragoso’s Erotemas chirurgicos en los que se enseña todo lo mas necessario del arte de cyrurgia (Madrid, 1570).

## 6. Ambrosio Nuñez, Tractado, repartido en cinco partes principales, Que declaran el mal que significa este nombre peste con todas sus causas, y señales prognostiças [sic], y indicativas del mal (Coimbra, 1601)
Nuñez (1531-1611) was a Portuguese doctor and professor at Salamanca. The book was printed in Coimbra, and was dedicated to a Portuguese aristocrat, Cristobal de Moura y Tavora. Portugal was under Spanish control from 1580 to 1640. The book is about the plague, and is divided into five parts. Middle Temple’s copy is heavily annotated in a contemporary hand, indicating the reader’s (possibly physician?) interest in what it has to say about the plague, and how to treat it.

## 7. Francisco Franco, Libro de enfermedades contagiosas y de la preservacion dellas (Seville, 1569)
As can be seen on the title page, this book once belonged to ‘H. Cobham’, that is, Sir Henry Brooke (1537-1592), 11th Baron Cobham. In the text, Cobham makes reference to Aristotle, Pliny, and other works on medicine. It is bound, and was probably originally issued with, Franco’s Tractado de la nieve y del uso della, a book about the medicinal properties of snow. Cobham was thought to have been the subject of Elizabethan satires written by Thomas Nashe and Ben Jonson. Cobham, along with Walter Raleigh and Thomas Grey, was involved in the ‘Main Plot’, an attempt to force a coup d’etat in 1603. Unsuccessful attempts were made to involve Spain with this plot. Cobham, Grey and Raleigh were imprisoned in the Tower of London after the coup d’etat failed.

## 8. Cristóbal de Vega, Commentaria in librum Galeni de differentia febrium (Compluti [i.e. Alcalá de Henares], 1553)
Vega (1510?-1573?) was an author of medical works and professor at the University of Alcalá, and physician Prince Don Carlos. De Vega wrote about the quartan fevers that Prince Don Carlos suffered in his work entitled Commentaria in librum Aphorismorum (1568). This book is a commentary on Galen’s works on fever, and is open to show a contemporary reader’s marginal notes. The book’s repair (it is missing its binding and has some paper tears) can be sponsored at a cost of £500. Please contact the Library for more information: library@middletemple.org.uk.

## 9. Alexandro (or Alejandro) Quintilio, Relacion y memoria de los maravillosos efetos, y notables provechos que han hecho, y hazen los polvos blancos solutivos de la quinta essencia del oro (Madrid, 1609)
Quintilio’s work is essentially an advertisement for a gold-based panacea that was manufactured and sold by an international network of licensees. This miracle drug was meant to cure all ills, including leprosy and diseases of the ‘rotten humors’. Quintilio was a Roman alchemist who worked in Madrid, and his book went through three editions (1607, 1609, 1616).

## 10. Colonialism and the Americas 
The Spanish conquest of South America began in the early sixteenth century, following Cristoforo Colombo’s voyages to the Americas. Initial expeditions to explore and conquer the American continent were led by ‘Conquistadors’, such as Francisco Pizarro and Diego de Almagro. Following a civil war in the Inca Empire that had decimated its population, Pizarro defeated the Inca Emperor Atahualpa in 1532, leading to the fall of the Empire.
<br><br>
Spain quickly set about establishing colonies in South America, establishing the Viceroyalty of Peru in 1542, governing much of western South America.
<br><br>
The quest for silver, gold, and other natural resources drove much of the exploration and conquests. Native populations resisted Spanish rule, but were ultimately overwhelmed by Spanish weaponry, and through exposure to diseases previously unseen, such as measles, smallpox, and typhus. The indigenous populations had no built-up immunity to such diseases. 
<br><br>
The conquistadors imposed cultural and religious changes, forcing the indigenous populations to adopt Catholicism and the Spanish language. They also enslaved the populations to assist them with their extraction of silver and gold, which was transported to Spain. The conquest led to significant demographic, cultural, and economic changes that continue to influence South American countries.

## 11. Bartolomé de las Casas, Tratado del Imperio Soberano y Principado Universal que los reyes de Castilla y Leon tienen sobre las Indias (Seville, 1552)
De las Casas is one of the most important primary sources for the Spanish conquest and colonization of the Americas. His most famous work was Brevísima Relación de la destrucción de las Indias, and with it, along with Tratado, Las Casas demonstrated his opposition to the Encomienda system. De las Casas entreated Charles V to cease the destruction in the Americas brought by the new Spanish nobles living there. Their system relied on forced indigenous labour, and las Casas tried to advance fair treatment for the indigenous peoples, and opposed slavery: “cease the havoc and destruction which has been perpetuated on the people of these lands.” – Nicholas Ricardo

## 12.  Bernardo de Vargas Machuca, Milicia y descripcion de las Indias (Madrid, 1599)
De Vargas wrote this book as a guide for Spanish garrisons in the New World. It is a staunchly pro-conquest book, in contrast to Bartolomé de las Casas. The narrative begins with a letter written by Alonso de Carbajal, another conquistador, who claims God himself allowed Machuca to “surpass by force the indomitable indian.” His book also expands his theory of geographic determinism to warfare, saying Africans fight with camels and throwing weapons, Orientals with elephants. Spaniards in the Levant fight with gun carts and missiles, and in Europe with pikes, halberds, swords, rapiers (which he claims the Swiss invented), arquebuses, cuirasses, harnesses, heavy calvary and infantry, amongst other weapons. In the Indies the Spaniards are not as “well supplied, relying on crossbows and shotguns they adapted for the American climate.” The indigenous people use fire-hardened spears made of palm, some use iron tips taken from Spaniards, along with maces, or obsidian swords, others use barbed and poisoned tips, darts, shields, helmets, blowguns tipped with poison. Machuca has nothing but disdain and indignation for the indigenous people, they are less than human to him, and he uses their lack of Christianity to justify the Spanish conquest. – Nicholas Ricardo
